Hey There!

My name is Arnav Tolat, and I am a junior at Dartmouth College pursuing a double-major in computer science and quantiative social science. In the classroom, I've taken courses including Data Structures and Algorithms, Machine Learning and Statistical Data Analysis, Discrete Mathematics, Digital Electronics, and Multivariable Calculus. Outside of the classroom, you can find me at a leadership meeting for the Dartmouth Investment and Philanthropy Program, swimming in the Connecticut River, or biking across campus. I'm passionate about using technology and data to better understand people and creating products which drive value in people's lives.
