### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ethan, a computer science student at Dartmouth College in Hanover, NH. I am originally from the D.C. area.

I am interested in programming, music, and gaming. In my studies, I am looking to learn more about machine learning, A.I., and web development.

### Note on Projects

I have privated those repositories that contain school projects so as to adhere to academic policies.

Among the private projects in my repositories are the: Tiny Search Engine, Collaborative Painting, POS Tagger, and Dartmouth Pathfinding.

My name is Arnav Tolat, and I am a junior at Dartmouth College pursuing a double major in computer science and mathematical data science. In the classroom, I've taken courses including Data Structures, Machine Learning and Statistical Data Analysis, Discrete Mathematics, Digital Electronics, and Multivariable Calculus. Outside of the classroom, I can be found swimming in the Connecticut River, attending a leadership meeting for the Dartmouth Investment and Philanthropy Program, or DJing my radio show on wDCR. I'm passionate about using technology and understanding data to deliver value for people.
