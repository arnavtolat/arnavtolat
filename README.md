My name is Arnav Tolat, and I am a junior at Dartmouth College pursuing a double major in computer science and mathematical data science. In the classroom, I've taken courses including Data Structures, Machine Learning and Statistical Data Analysis, Discrete Mathematics, Digital Electronics, and Multivariable Calculus. Outside of the classroom, I can be found swimming in the Connecticut River, attending a leadership meeting for the Dartmouth Investment and Philanthropy Program, or DJing my radio show on wDCR. I'm passionate about using technology and understanding data to deliver value for people.

### Technical Skills :hammer:
I have worked extensively with Java, Python, VHDL, Matlab, C, R and Stata. Within Python, I have experience with the NumPy, pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, pymc3, Statsmodels, and NLTK libraries. I also have experience with LaTeX, Photoshop, Excel and Figma.

### Hey! I'm Arnav, a student at [Dartmouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_College) interested in Computer Science, Economics, and Statistics.

On campus, I'm pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Mathematical Data Science while TAing courses in computer science and mathematics and leading organizations including the [Dartmouth Investment and Philanthropy Program](https://dippnh.org), [The Dartmouth](https://www.thedartmouth.com), and the Dartmouth Emerging Markets Group. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, DJing a radio show, and playing chess. 

Most of my projects are in private repos, so if you're interested in seeing them, please reach out via LinkedIn or email!
